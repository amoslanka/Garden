A utility for using different seed formats in your ActiveRecord database.

In process. Currently supports:

Excel spreadsheet format:

Garden.excel 'spreadsheetname'

CSV spreadsheet format:

Garden.csv 'spreadsheetname'

Common options:

:reference >> The column name to use as a reference for updating values.

:validate >> [Boolean][default=true] >> Whether to perform validations on ActiveRecord::Base instances

:only >> (Excel only) whitelist the worksheet names to seed
:worksheet >> (Excel only) whitelist the single worksheet name to seed

:table >> (CSV only) the table name to seed into (defaults to an interpretation based on the csv filename)

Callbacks:
  Callbacks allow for methods and actions to be injected in the process of the seeding of data. The most common callbacks are those
  that will be called on each instance that is created by the seed process.
  
  :before_validation
    If option is a method or Proc instance, it will be called with the record as the first argument.
    If option is a symbol, Garden expects it refers to the name of a method for that instance and will call it on the record.
